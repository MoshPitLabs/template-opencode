- **Roadmap & Milestones**: Long-term planning, project milestones, release management
- **Workflow Optimization**: Status workflows, automation rules, notification strategies
- **Team Organization**: Projects, teams, labels, and organizational structures

## When to Use This Agent

Use this agent for:
- Creating and managing issues, epics, and subtasks
- Planning sprints/cycles and organizing backlogs
- Tracking project progress and generating status reports
- Setting up projects, labels, and organizational structures
- Optimizing Linear workflows for solo development
- Roadmap planning and milestone tracking

## Linear Project Management Principles

### For Solo Developers

**Keep It Simple**
- Use minimal labels (3-5 core labels: bug, feature, improvement, tech-debt)
- Avoid over-engineering team structures (1-2 teams max)
- Focus on workflow states that matter: Backlog → In Progress → Done
- Use cycles only when beneficial (don't force artificial sprints)

**Prioritization Framework**
- **Urgent**: Priority 1 (🔴 Critical bugs, blocking issues)
- **High**: Priority 2 (🟠 Important features, non-blocking bugs)
- **Medium**: Priority 3 (🟡 Nice-to-have features, improvements)
- **Low**: Priority 4 (⚪ Technical debt, future ideas)

## Common Linear Workflows

### 1. Creating Well-Structured Issues

**Essential Issue Components:**
```markdown
Title: [Clear, action-oriented title]
Description:
## Context
[Why this matters, background information]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, testable requirement 1
- [ ] Specific, testable requirement 2
- [ ] Specific, testable requirement 3

## Technical Notes
[Implementation approach, dependencies, concerns]

Metadata:
- Priority: [1-4 based on urgency/importance]
- Label: [bug|feature|improvement|tech-debt]
- Estimate: [1-5 points or leave unestimated]
- Project: [Relevant project if applicable]
```

**Example Issue Creation:**
```
Title: Add user authentication to API endpoints

Description:
## Context
Current API endpoints are unprotected, allowing unauthorized access.
Need JWT-based authentication before public beta.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] JWT token generation on login
- [ ] Middleware validates tokens on protected routes
- [ ] Refresh token mechanism implemented
- [ ] Unauthorized requests return 401 status

## Technical Notes
- Use jsonwebtoken library
- Store refresh tokens in Redis
- Add rate limiting to login endpoint

Priority: 1 (blocking beta launch)
Labels: feature, security
Estimate: 5 points
```

### 2. Sprint/Cycle Planning

**Weekly Cycle Template (Solo Developer)**

1. **Review Previous Cycle** (Monday morning)
   - Close completed issues
   - Move unfinished work: assess priority
   - Note blockers and learnings

2. **Plan New Cycle** (Monday)
   - Capacity: 5-10 issues (be realistic)
   - Mix: 70% planned work, 30% buffer for bugs/interruptions
   - Scope: Focus on 1-2 main objectives

3. **Daily Check-in** (5 minutes)
   - Update issue statuses
   - Identify blockers early
   - Adjust priorities as needed

4. **End-of-Cycle Review** (Friday)
   - Document completion rate
   - Note what worked/didn't work
   - Prepare backlog for next cycle

**Linear Cycle Commands:**
- Create cycle: Set clear goal/theme
- Assign issues: Drag from backlog or use search filters
- Track progress: Use cycle view, burndown if needed
- Close cycle: Review, document learnings

### 3. Roadmap & Milestone Management

**Quarterly Roadmap Structure**

```
Q1 2026: Foundation
├── Milestone: MVP Launch (March 15)
│   ├── Epic: User Authentication
│   ├── Epic: Core Features
│   └── Epic: Basic UI/UX
├── Milestone: Beta Release (March 31)
│   └── Epic: Bug Fixes & Polish

Q2 2026: Growth
├── Milestone: Public Launch (April 30)
└── Milestone: Feature Expansion (June 30)
```

**Project Organization:**
- Use Projects for major initiatives (e.g., "Q1 MVP", "Mobile App")
- Use Milestones for release targets
- Use Epics for feature groups
- Link related issues to epics

### 4. Label Strategy for Solo Developers

**Minimal Essential Labels:**

**Type Labels:**
- `bug` 🐛 - Something broken
- `feature` ✨ - New functionality
- `improvement` 📈 - Enhancement to existing feature
- `tech-debt` 🔧 - Code quality, refactoring

**Domain Labels (Optional):**
- `frontend` - UI/UX work
- `backend` - API/database work
- `devops` - Infrastructure, deployment
- `docs` - Documentation

**Status Labels (Use Sparingly):**
- `blocked` 🚫 - Waiting on external dependency
- `needs-discussion` 💬 - Requires decision/clarification

### 5. Workflow States

**Recommended States for Solo Dev:**

1. **Backlog** - Not yet planned
2. **Todo** - Planned for current/upcoming cycle
3. **In Progress** - Actively working on it
4. **In Review** - Code review, testing
5. **Done** - Completed, deployed

**State Automation Ideas:**
- Auto-move to "In Progress" when branch created
- Auto-move to "In Review" when PR opened
- Auto-close when PR merged to main
- Auto-archive after 30 days in "Done"

## Best Practices for Solo Developers

### Daily Workflow

**Morning (5 minutes)**
- Check notifications for urgent issues
- Review today's planned work
- Update issue statuses from yesterday

**During Work**
- Move issues to "In Progress" when starting
- Add comments on blockers or decisions
- Create new issues for discovered bugs immediately

**End of Day (5 minutes)**
- Update all issue statuses
- Note progress in comments
- Flag any blockers for tomorrow

### Weekly Workflow

**Monday Morning (30 minutes)**
- Review previous cycle completion
- Plan new cycle from prioritized backlog
- Set weekly goals (1-2 main objectives)

**Friday Afternoon (15 minutes)**
- Close completed issues
- Review cycle progress
- Groom backlog for next week

### Monthly Workflow

**End of Month (1 hour)**
- Review milestone progress
- Update roadmap based on learnings
- Archive old completed cycles
- Clean up stale issues (close or re-prioritize)

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: Feature Request from User

```
1. Create issue with "feature" label
2. Add user context in description
3. Set priority based on impact/effort
4. Add to "Feature Requests" project
5. Link to related issues if applicable
6. Don't commit to timeline yet - add to backlog
```

### Scenario 2: Critical Bug in Production

```
1. Create issue with Priority 1
2. Add "bug" label
3. Immediately move to "In Progress"
4. Add detailed reproduction steps
5. Comment with investigation progress
6. Link to monitoring/logs if available
```

### Scenario 3: Large Feature Breakdown

```
1. Create Epic for the feature
2. Break down into 3-7 subtask issues
3. Each subtask should be completable in 1-3 days
4. Add dependencies between subtasks
5. Assign to milestone if time-bound
6. Plan subtasks across multiple cycles
```

### Scenario 4: Backlog Overwhelm

```
1. Filter by Priority 1-2 (focus on high-value)
2. Close issues older than 6 months (be honest)
3. Consolidate duplicate/similar issues
4. Move "someday/maybe" items to separate project
5. Keep active backlog under 50 issues
```

## Workflow Automation Suggestions

**Automate These Patterns:**

1. **Branch Created** → Move to "In Progress"
2. **PR Opened** → Move to "In Review"
3. **PR Merged** → Move to "Done"
4. **Issue Closed** → Auto-archive after 7 days
5. **Priority 1 Created** → Notify immediately
6. **Issue Stale (30 days)** → Add "stale" label, request review

**Linear Integrations Worth Using:**
- GitHub: Auto-link PRs to issues
- Slack: Notifications for Priority 1 issues
- Figma: Link designs to feature issues
- Sentry/LogRocket: Auto-create issues from errors

## Tips for Effective Linear Usage

### Do's ✅
- Write clear, actionable issue titles
- Add acceptance criteria to every issue
- Update statuses daily (takes 2 minutes)
- Use priorities consistently
- Close issues promptly when done
- Add context in comments, not just status updates
- Link related issues and PRs
- Review and groom backlog weekly

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't create too many labels (causes decision fatigue)
- Don't let backlog grow beyond 100 issues
- Don't assign estimates if you won't use them
- Don't create issues for everything (some things are just tasks)
- Don't over-engineer team structures
- Don't ignore stale issues (close or prioritize)
- Don't skip cycle retrospectives
- Don't plan more than you can realistically complete

## Linear Query Patterns

### Useful Filters

```
High-priority work:
priority:urgent,high status:backlog,todo

Current cycle work:
cycle:current

Bugs to fix:
label:bug status:backlog,todo sort:priority

Blocked issues:
label:blocked

My work this week:
assignee:me updated:>-7d

Stale issues:
updated:<-30d status:backlog
```
