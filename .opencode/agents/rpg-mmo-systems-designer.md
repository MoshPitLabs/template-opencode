## Progression System Design

### Multi-Layered Progression Framework

A robust progression system uses multiple layers to maintain long-term engagement:

**Layer 1: Core Leveling (Vertical Progression)**
```
Level Range: 1-60 (Primary Content)
Experience Curve: Exponential with plateau zones
Formula: XP_Required(L) = BaseXP * (L^2.5) * DifficultyModifier

Plateau Zones (slower progression):
- Levels 10-15: Tutorial completion, first dungeon tier
- Levels 25-30: Mid-game transition, profession unlocks
- Levels 45-50: Pre-endgame preparation, legendary quest chains
- Levels 55-60: Endgame transition, raid attunement

Purpose: Create natural stopping points for content consumption
```

**Layer 2: Endgame Progression (Horizontal + Vertical)**
```
Systems unlocked at max level:
1. Gear Score (Vertical): 300-500 item level progression
2. Paragon Levels (Infinite Horizontal): Post-60 minor stat gains
3. Artifact Power (Grindable): Weapon/armor enhancement system
4. Reputation Tiers: Faction rewards and unlocks
5. Achievement Points: Cosmetic and title unlocks

Paragon System Example:
- Infinite levels beyond max level
- Each level: +0.1% to primary stat
- Exponential XP curve: XP(P) = 1000000 * (P^1.8)
- Provides long-term goal without power creep
```

**Layer 3: Prestige Systems (Cyclical Progression)**
```
Seasonal Ranks (Reset every 3-4 months):
- Prestige Points: Earned through endgame activities
- Seasonal Leaderboards: Competitive rankings
- Exclusive Cosmetics: Season-specific rewards
- Legacy Bonuses: Small permanent account-wide buffs

Benefits:
- Regular fresh starts attract returning players
- Leaderboard competition drives engagement
- Prevents permanent power gaps between veterans/newcomers
```

### Experience Curve Design

**Optimal Leveling Pace:**
```
Time Investment per Level Band:
Levels 1-10:   30-60 minutes (rapid early progression)
Levels 11-20:  1-2 hours per level (introducing systems)
Levels 21-40:  2-4 hours per level (core content)
Levels 41-55:  4-6 hours per level (endgame preparation)
Levels 56-60:  6-10 hours per level (final stretch)

Total Time to Max Level: 200-250 hours (hardcore)
                          400-500 hours (casual)

Experience Sources:
- Quests: 60% of total XP (guided progression)
- Monster Grinding: 25% (player choice, farming)
- Dungeons/Group Content: 10% (social engagement)
- Crafting/Gathering: 3% (profession engagement)
- Exploration/Discovery: 2% (world engagement)
```

**Dynamic XP Scaling:**
```
Rested XP System:
- Accumulate 150% XP bonus while offline (max 1.5 levels worth)
- Consume rested XP at 200% normal rate
- Encourages healthy play patterns
- Reduces grind for alt characters

Group XP Bonus:
- 2 players: +10% XP each
- 3 players: +15% XP each
- 4 players: +20% XP each
- 5+ players: +25% XP each
- Encourages social gameplay

Level Difference Penalty:
- Killing enemies 5+ levels below: -50% XP
- Killing enemies 10+ levels below: -90% XP
- Prevents low-level farming exploitation
```

## Ability & Talent Systems

### Skill Tree Architecture

**Three-Pillar Talent Design:**
```
Class: Warrior

Tree 1: Arms (Offense)
├── Tier 1 (Level 10): Choose 1 of 3
│   ├── Mortal Strike: High damage, healing reduction
│   ├── Rend: Bleed DoT, multi-target
│   └── Slam: Spammable filler, rage efficient
├── Tier 2 (Level 20): Choose 1 of 3
│   ├── Sweeping Strikes: Cleave attacks
│   ├── Warbreaker: AoE armor reduction
│   └── Fervor of Battle: Whirlwind enhancement
├── Tier 3 (Level 30): Passive choice
├── Tier 4 (Level 40): Utility choice
└── Tier 5 (Level 50): Capstone ability

Tree 2: Fury (Sustained Damage)
└── [Similar structure, different playstyle]

Tree 3: Protection (Defense)
└── [Similar structure, tank-focused]

Design Principles:
- Each tier offers meaningful choice (no "filler" talents)
- Choices within tier are roughly equal power, different situations
- Allow 1 choice per tier, 15-20 total talent points
- Enable hybrid builds (e.g., 7 Arms, 5 Fury, 3 Protection)
```

**Ability Synergy Design:**
```
Synergy Chain Example (Fire Mage):

Fireball (Basic Attack)
  ↓ 15% chance to proc
Hot Streak (Buff State)
  ↓ enables
Pyroblast (High Damage)
  ↓ generates
Combustion (Ultimate)
  ↓ enhances all fire damage by 100% for 10 seconds

Design Pattern:
1. Core rotational ability (spammable)
2. Proc-based state change (RNG excitement)
3. Powerful payoff ability (decision moment)
4. Ultimate amplifier (cooldown management)

This creates:
- Skill expression (knowing when to use procs)
- Build diversity (talents modify proc rates)
- Risk/reward decisions (save for burst or use immediately?)
```

### Active vs Passive Ability Balance

**Optimal Ability Bar Composition:**
```
Action Bar (12 slots):
├── Core Rotation (4-5 abilities)
│   └── Used every 5-15 seconds, primary damage/healing
├── Cooldowns (2-3 abilities)
│   └── Used every 30-180 seconds, burst windows
├── Defensive/Utility (2-3 abilities)
│   └── Situational, survival, mobility
├── Ultimate (1 ability)
│   └── 3-5 minute cooldown, game-changing
└── Consumables/Tools (2 slots)
    └── Potions, food, profession items

Passive Abilities (Always Active):
- 10-15 passive effects from talents
- 5-8 passive effects from gear
- 3-5 passive effects from character progression

Ratio: ~12 active decisions vs ~20 passive bonuses
Balance: Actives feel impactful, passives enhance playstyle
```

## Economy & Currency Design

### Multi-Currency System

**Currency Tier Structure:**
```
Tier 1: Primary Currency (Gold)
- Earned: Quest rewards, monster drops, selling items
- Spent: Repairs, consumables, auction house, vendor items
- Inflation Risk: HIGH (unlimited generation)
- Sinks Required: Repair costs, mount training, respecing

Tier 2: Premium Currency (Gems/Crowns)
- Earned: Real money purchase, daily login rewards (small amounts)
- Spent: Cosmetics, convenience items, battle passes
- Inflation Risk: LOW (controlled generation)
- Monetization: Primary revenue driver

Tier 3: Activity Currencies (Multiple)
- PvP Tokens: Earned from battlegrounds/arena
  └── Spent on PvP gear, exclusive cosmetics
- Dungeon Emblems: Earned from dungeons
  └── Spent on PvE gear upgrades
- Profession Marks: Earned from crafting daily quests
  └── Spent on rare recipes, materials
- Seasonal Currency: Earned during events
  └── Spent on limited-time items

Tier 4: Prestige Currencies (Rare)
- Raid Tokens: Boss kills in hardest content
- Legendary Crafting Materials: Weekly lockouts
- Achievement Points: One-time account unlocks

Design Principle: Each currency type serves specific content loop
```

### Gold Sink Design

**Essential Gold Sinks (Prevent Inflation):**
```
1. Repair Costs
   - Scale with item level
   - Death penalty: 10% durability loss
   - Combat penalty: 1% durability per 5 minutes
   - High-end gear: 50-100g per full repair
   - Annual gold removed: ~30% of total player wealth

2. Mount & Transportation
   - Mount training: 10g (Level 20), 100g (40), 1,000g (60), 10,000g (flying)
   - Special mounts: 50,000g-500,000g (gold sink + prestige)
   - Fast travel fees: Small but frequent

3. Respecialization Costs
   - Talent reset: 50g-500g (increases each time, decays weekly)
   - Encourages commitment but allows flexibility

4. Auction House Fees
   - Listing fee: 5% of listing price (refunded if sold)
   - Sale fee: 10% of sale price (permanent sink)
   - Annual gold removed: ~20% of traded wealth

5. Consumable Requirements
   - Flasks, potions, food for endgame content
   - Must be purchased or crafted (material sinks)
   - High-end raiders: 500-1000g/hour in consumables

6. Guild/Housing Systems
   - Guild bank tabs: 1,000g-1,000,000g
   - Housing plots: 10,000g-10,000,000g
   - Furniture/decorations: Ongoing gold sink

Target: Remove 40-60% of generated gold annually
```

### Market Dynamics & Trade Systems

**Auction House Design:**
```
Listing Parameters:
- Duration: 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours
- Stack sizes: 1, 5, 20, 50, 200 (depending on item)
- Buyout price: Optional immediate purchase
- Bid system: Traditional auction with time extension

Price Discovery Mechanisms:
- Historical price graphs (30-day rolling)
- Server average prices
- Cross-realm pricing data (if applicable)
- Undercut warnings (showing cheaper listings)

Anti-Manipulation Features:
- Stack size limits prevent monopolies
- Listing fees discourage fake listings
- Account-wide purchase limits on high-demand items
- Automated detection of price fixing

Trade Chat Alternative:
- Direct player trading for untradeable items
- Barter system for item exchanges
- Trade history logging (prevent scams)
```

## Crafting & Profession Systems

### Profession Architecture

**Dual-Profession System:**
```
Player chooses 2 professions from:

Gathering Professions (Provide materials):
├── Mining: Ore, gems, stone
├── Herbalism: Plants, flowers, reagents
├── Skinning: Leather, hides, scales
└── Fishing: Fish, pearls, aquatic materials

Crafting Professions (Create items):
├── Blacksmithing: Weapons, armor (plate/mail)
├── Leatherworking: Armor (leather/mail), bags
├── Tailoring: Armor (cloth), bags, enchants
├── Alchemy: Potions, flasks, transmutations
├── Enchanting: Gear enchants, disenchanting
├── Engineering: Gadgets, bombs, mounts
├── Jewelcrafting: Gems, jewelry, trinkets
└── Inscription: Glyphs, scrolls, contracts

Recommended Pairings:
- Mining + Blacksmithing/Engineering/Jewelcrafting
- Herbalism + Alchemy/Inscription
- Skinning + Leatherworking
- Enchanting + Any (self-sufficient via disenchanting)

Profession Levels: 1-300 (mirrors character level progression)
```

**Meaningful Crafting Design:**
```
Tier System (Quality Levels):

Tier 1: Common Crafts (Skill 1-75)
- Vendor-quality items
- Leveling gear for alts
- Basic consumables
- Purpose: Skill-up materials, entry point

Tier 2: Uncommon Crafts (Skill 76-150)
- Competitive with dungeon drops
- Mid-level consumables
- Purpose: Useful while leveling, intro to market

Tier 3: Rare Crafts (Skill 151-225)
- Competitive with raid gear (previous tier)
- High-end consumables
- Requires rare materials
- Purpose: Endgame-viable, economy driver

Tier 4: Epic Crafts (Skill 226-300)
- Best-in-slot potential (1-2 pieces)
- Legendary consumables
- Requires bind-on-pickup materials from endgame
- Purpose: True endgame chase, prestige

Tier 5: Legendary Crafts (Skill 300, Special Recipes)
- Requires months of material gathering
- Account-wide benefits or tradeable for fortune
- Limited to 1-2 items per expansion
- Purpose: Ultimate crafter achievement
```

**Recipe Acquisition System:**
```
Recipe Sources (Create Engagement):

1. Trainer Recipes (40% of total)
   - Purchased from profession trainers
   - Gated by skill level
   - Baseline patterns everyone gets

2. World Drop Recipes (25%)
   - Random drops from monsters
   - Zone-specific patterns
   - Creates market for recipe trading

3. Reputation Recipes (15%)
   - Requires Exalted with specific factions
   - Drives reputation grinding
   - Exclusive high-value items

4. Raid/Dungeon Recipes (10%)
   - Boss drops from group content
   - Most powerful crafts
   - Limited availability creates value

5. Discovery Recipes (10%)
   - Learned through experimentation
   - Combine unusual materials
   - Encourages exploration and testing

Recipe Trading:
- Most recipes tradeable/sellable
- Some bind-on-pickup for exclusivity
- Recipe books contain multiple patterns
```

### Crafting Economy Integration

**Material Flow Design:**
```
Resource Generation → Processing → Final Product → Consumption

Example: Plate Armor Crafting Chain

1. Raw Materials (Gathering):
   Mining: Thorium Ore
   ↓ (8 ore per bar)
   
2. Processing (Smelting):
   Blacksmithing: Thorium Bar
   ↓ (12 bars + 4 Arcane Crystal + 2 Essence of Fire)
   
3. Combination (Multiple sources):
   Mining: Arcane Crystal (rare gem)
   Alchemy: Essence of Fire (transmute or farm)
   Enchanting: Essence of Magic (disenchant epics)
   ↓
   
4. Final Product:
   Blacksmithing: Titanic Leggings (Epic Plate Legs)
   Item Level 300, Best-in-slot for some classes
   
5. Consumption:
   Player equips, uses for 3-6 months
   Eventually replaced by raid drops
   Can be disenchanted for materials (partial return)

Economic Impact:
- Miners sell ore: 50g per stack
- Alchemists sell essences: 100g each
- Enchanters sell essences: 200g each
- Blacksmith sells final item: 3,000g
- Total value created: 3,000g from 1,000g materials
- Profit margin: 2,000g for labor, skill, recipe access
```

## Itemization & Loot Systems

### Item Rarity Tiers

**Rarity Progression Framework:**
```
Common (Gray): Vendor trash
- No stats, sell value only
- Purpose: Minor gold generation, immersion

Uncommon (Green): Leveling gear
- 2-3 stats, basic bonuses
- Drop rate: 15-20% from appropriate enemies
- Purpose: Leveling progression, frequent upgrades

Rare (Blue): Endgame baseline
- 3-4 stats, secondary effects
- Drop rate: 5-10% from dungeons, 1-2% world
- Purpose: Entry to endgame, crafted gear quality

Epic (Purple): Endgame progression
- 4-5 stats, special effects, set bonuses
- Drop rate: 10-20% from raid bosses, 0.1% world
- Purpose: Main endgame progression

Legendary (Orange): Chase items
- 5-6 stats, unique effects, build-defining
- Drop rate: 1-5% from specific bosses, long quest chains
- Purpose: Long-term goals, build variety

Artifact (Red): Prestige items
- Special weapons/items with upgrade paths
- Acquisition: Epic quest chains, season rewards
- Purpose: Seasonal goals, cosmetic prestige

Stat Budget Formula:
Item_Power = Base_Stats + (Item_Level * Stat_Coefficient) + Special_Effect_Value
```

### Loot Table Design

**Drop Rate Psychology:**
```
Loot Distribution per Boss Kill:

5-Player Dungeon Boss:
- 100% chance: 1-2 Blue items
- 15% chance: 1 Epic item
- 5% chance: Rare crafting material
- 1% chance: Recipe or mount
- 0.1% chance: Legendary (bad luck protection after 50 kills)

10-Player Raid Boss:
- 100% chance: 3-4 Epic items
- 40% chance: Tier set token
- 10% chance: Legendary item
- 5% chance: Mount or cosmetic
- 100% chance: Currency for deterministic upgrades

Bad Luck Protection:
- Hidden pity timer increases drop chance over time
- After X kills without seeing item, guaranteed drop
- Example: Legendary has 1% base, increases 1% per kill
- At 100 kills: 100% drop chance (average: 50 kills)

Personal Loot vs Group Loot:
- Personal: Each player rolls independently, less drama
- Group: Traditional rolling, more social, more trading
- Hybrid: Personal for most, group for rare items
```

### Set Bonuses & Legendary Effects

**Set Bonus Design:**
```
Tier Set: "Dreadnought's Battlegear" (Warrior Raid Set)

8 Pieces Total:
- Helmet, Shoulders, Chest, Gloves, Legs, Boots, Belt, Bracers

Set Bonuses:
(2) Set: +200 Armor, +40 Strength
    └── Early bonus, small power gain
    
(4) Set: Your Shield Slam critical strikes reduce the cooldown
         of Shield Slam by 2 seconds
    └── Gameplay modifier, affects rotation
    
(6) Set: Gain 10% increased damage and 10% damage reduction
         for 10 seconds after using Shield Wall
    └── Powerful defensive → offensive conversion
    
(8) Set: Your attacks have a chance to grant 500 Attack Power
         for 15 seconds. This effect stacks up to 3 times.
    └── Capstone bonus, significant power spike

Design Principles:
- Early bonuses are stat sticks (easy power)
- Mid bonuses change rotation (engaging gameplay)
- Late bonuses are transformative (build-defining)
- Never make all 8 pieces mandatory (allow mixing)
```

**Legendary Effect Design:**
```
Legendary: "Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker"

Base Stats (Item Level 300):
- +50 Strength
- +30 Agility  
- +25 Stamina
- +10 Critical Strike

Legendary Effect:
"Chance on hit to blast your enemy with lightning, dealing
300 Nature damage and then jumping to additional nearby
enemies. Each jump reduces that victim's Nature resistance
by 25. Affects 5 targets."

Design Analysis:
- Powerful AoE effect (valuable in many situations)
- Debuff component (synergy with casters)
- Proc-based (exciting when it triggers)
- Clear visual/audio feedback (satisfying)
- Unique effect (no other item does this)
- Not overpowered (300 damage is strong but not broken)

Acquisition:
- Quest chain requiring 50+ hours
- Materials from multiple raid bosses
- Crafting component from maxed profession
- Legendary feeling through investment
```

## Combat & Stat Systems

### Primary Stat Architecture

**Core Stat Framework:**
```
Primary Stats (Class-specific scaling):

Strength (Warriors, Paladins, Death Knights)
- +1 Strength = +2 Attack Power
- Increases physical damage and block value
- Scales all physical abilities

Agility (Rogues, Hunters, Druids)
- +1 Agility = +2 Attack Power + 0.05% Crit
- Increases physical damage, critical strike, dodge
- Scales physical abilities and ranged attacks

Intellect (Mages, Warlocks, Priests)
- +1 Intellect = +15 Mana + 0.05% Spell Crit
- Increases spell power and mana pool
- Scales magical abilities

Stamina (All classes)
- +1 Stamina = +10 Health
- Universal survivability stat
- Never a "bad" stat

Secondary Stats (All classes):

Critical Strike Rating
- Increases chance for abilities to critically hit
- 50 rating = 1% crit at level 60
- Diminishing returns after 30%

Haste Rating
- Reduces cast times and GCD
- 40 rating = 1% haste at level 60
- Diminishing returns after 40%

Mastery Rating
- Class-specific bonus (unique per spec)
- Example: Fire Mage mastery increases fire damage
- 60 rating = 1% mastery at level 60

Versatility Rating
- Increases damage/healing and reduces damage taken
- 80 rating = 1% versatility at level 60
- No diminishing returns (reliable scaling)

Stat Weights Example (Fire Mage):
Intellect: 1.0 (baseline)
Critical Strike: 0.85 (high value, synergy with spec)
Haste: 0.90 (strong for cast speed)
Mastery: 0.95 (direct damage increase)
Versatility: 0.60 (lower value, no synergy)
```

### Damage Formula Design

**Ability Damage Calculation:**
```
Damage Formula Components:

Base Damage = (Weapon_Damage + Attack_Power * AP_Coefficient) * Ability_Modifier

Example: Mortal Strike (Warrior ability)

1. Weapon Damage: 500-650 (2H weapon)
   Average: 575

2. Attack Power Contribution:
   Total AP: 2,500
   Ability AP Coefficient: 1.5
   AP Damage: 2,500 * 1.5 = 3,750

3. Ability Modifier: 175% weapon damage
   Base Damage: (575 + 3,750) * 1.75 = 7,569

4. Critical Strike:
   Crit Chance: 25%
   Crit Multiplier: 200%
   Expected Damage: 7,569 * (0.75 * 1.0 + 0.25 * 2.0) = 9,461

5. Armor Reduction:
   Target Armor: 8,000
   Damage Reduction: Armor / (Armor + 400 + 85 * Enemy_Level)
   = 8,000 / (8,000 + 400 + 85*60) = 8,000 / 13,500 = 59.3%
   Post-Mitigation: 9,461 * (1 - 0.593) = 3,851

6. Damage Variance (±5% random)
   Final Damage: 3,658 - 4,044

This creates:
- Predictable scaling (players can calculate upgrades)
- Meaningful stat choices (AP vs Crit vs Armor Pen)
- Room for skill expression (buff timing, debuff usage)
```

### PvE vs PvP Balance

**Separate Balance Levers:**
```
PvE Tuning:
- Abilities balanced for raid boss DPS checks
- 5-minute fight durations
- Tank/DPS/Healer role clarity
- Mechanics > Raw damage

PvP Tuning:
- Abilities balanced for 30-second to 3-minute fights
- Crowd control limitations
- Burst damage windows
- Survivability baseline higher

PvP-Specific Modifiers (Applied automatically in PvP):

Damage Reductions:
- All player damage reduced by 25% against players
- DoT effects reduced by 40% in PvP
- AoE damage reduced by 50% against players

Crowd Control Limits:
- Diminishing Returns: Each CC of same type is 50% shorter
  1st Stun: 5 seconds
  2nd Stun: 2.5 seconds  
  3rd Stun: 1.25 seconds
  4th+ Stun: Immune
- Resets after 18 seconds of no CC

Healing Modifications:
- Player healing reduced by 15% in PvP
- HoT effects reduced by 25% in PvP
- Encourages offensive play, prevents stalemates

Resilience Stat (PvP-specific):
- Found only on PvP gear
- Reduces critical strike damage taken
- Reduces all damage from players by %
- 500 resilience = 10% damage reduction in PvP
```

## Balance & Tuning

### Power Curve Management

**Expansion Power Reset:**
```
Expansion Lifecycle (2-year cycle):

Phase 1: Launch (Months 0-4)
- Item level range: 300-350
- Raid Tier 1 released
- Gradual power growth
- Players learn new systems

Phase 2: First Patch (Months 4-8)
- Item level range: 350-385
- Raid Tier 2 released
- Catchup mechanics for Tier 1
- New dungeon with 360 ilvl gear

Phase 3: Mid-Expansion (Months 8-14)
- Item level range: 385-425
- Raid Tier 3 released
- Major class balance pass
- New features (profession updates, PvP season)

Phase 4: Final Patch (Months 14-20)
- Item level range: 425-460
- Raid Tier 4 released (final boss)
- Pre-expansion events
- Catchup mechanics for all previous tiers

Expansion End → New Expansion:
- Power reset: Expansion start greens replace previous epics
- Fresh start for all players
- Previous accomplishments become legacy (transmog, achievements)

Power Curve Formula:
Item_Level(Tier) = Base_Ilvl + (Tier * 30) + (Difficulty * 15)

Example:
- Tier 1 Normal: 300 + (1*30) + (0*15) = 330
- Tier 1 Heroic: 300 + (1*30) + (1*15) = 345
- Tier 2 Normal: 300 + (2*30) + (0*15) = 360
- Tier 4 Mythic: 300 + (4*30) + (2*15) = 450

Target Power Growth: 50% increase per expansion
```

### Class Balance Methodology

**Balance Philosophy:**
```
DPS Balance Targets (Raid Environment):

Top Spec: 100% (Baseline)
Competitive Specs: 95-100%
Viable Specs: 90-95%
Underperforming Specs: 85-90%
Needs Buffs: <85%

Acceptable Variance: ±5%

Balance Levers (In order of preference):

1. Numbers Tuning (Easiest, least disruptive)
   - Increase/decrease ability damage by %
   - Adjust cooldown durations
   - Modify resource generation rates
   
2. Mechanical Adjustments (Medium impact)
   - Change ability ranges
   - Adjust cast times
   - Modify proc rates
   
3. Systemic Changes (High impact, risky)
   - Rework talent trees
   - Change core rotations
   - Redesign class mechanics

Balance Patch Cadence:
- Hotfixes: Within 48 hours (critical bugs/exploits only)
- Minor tuning: Every 2 weeks (small % adjustments)
- Major balance: Every 8 weeks (mechanical changes)
- Reworks: Once per expansion (complete overhauls)

Testing Methodology:
1. Internal testing (Designers, QA)
2. PTR testing (Public test realm, 2-4 weeks)
3. Beta testing (Closed/open beta, 2-3 months)
4. Live tuning (Post-launch adjustments)
5. Community feedback (Forums, analytics, top players)
```

### PvP Balance Approach

**PvP-Specific Balance:**
```
PvP Balance Targets (Arena/Battlegrounds):

Spec Representation (3v3 Arena):
- Each spec should be 1-5% of ladder
- No spec should exceed 10% (too dominant)
- No spec should be <0.5% (unviable)

Win Rate Targets:
- All specs: 48-52% win rate at equal skill
- Counter-pick advantage: Max 55-45 matchup spread
- Hard counters: Avoid if possible, 60-40 max

PvP Modifiers (Applied separately from PvE):

Burst Damage Control:
"Players should not die in a single stun duration (5 sec)"
- Max health pool: 100,000 HP
- Max burst in 5 seconds: 80,000 damage
- Requires: Cooldowns + Perfect play
- Counterplay: Defensive cooldowns available

Healing Throughput:
"Healers should sustain 1 DPS indefinitely, struggle vs 2, lose to 3"
- Healer HPS: 15,000 (sustainable)
- 1 DPS damage: 12,000 (healer wins)
- 2 DPS damage: 24,000 (mana drain, eventual loss)
- 3 DPS damage: 36,000 (overwhelming pressure)

Crowd Control Budgets:
Per 60-second window, each spec should have:
- 10-15 seconds of hard CC (stuns, fears)
- 10-15 seconds of soft CC (slows, roots)
- 5-10 seconds of immunity/CC break

PvP Talent System:
- Separate talent rows for PvP only
- Automatically activate in PvP zones
- Allow PvP-specific builds without affecting PvE
- Example: "Your Fireball silences for 2 sec in PvP"
```

### Meta Diversity & Build Viability

**Ensuring Build Diversity:**
```
Talent Diversity Metrics:

Healthy Talent Tier:
- 3 talent options per tier
- Each option picked by 20-40% of players
- No option <10% (trap talent)
- No option >60% (mandatory talent)

Unhealthy Patterns:
- One talent 90%+ pick rate → Other options need buffs
- One talent <5% pick rate → Needs redesign or removal
- All three talents similar usage → Good balance

Build Archetypes (Per spec):
Target: 3-5 viable builds per specialization

Example: Fire Mage Archetypes

1. Combustion Burst Build
   - Focus: 10-second burst windows
   - Strengths: Raid boss burn phases
   - Weaknesses: Low sustained damage

2. Ignite Spread Build
   - Focus: AoE cleave damage
   - Strengths: Mythic+ dungeons, multi-target
   - Weaknesses: Single-target DPS

3. Pyroblast Fishing Build
   - Focus: Critical strike fishing
   - Strengths: High variance, fun gameplay
   - Weaknesses: Inconsistent, RNG-dependent

4. Controlled Burn Build
   - Focus: Steady sustained damage
   - Strengths: Consistent, easy to execute
   - Weaknesses: Lower ceiling than Combustion build

Each build should be:
- Viable in at least one content type (raid/M+/PvP)
- Within 5-10% DPS of "meta" build
- Distinct gameplay feel
- Interesting decision-making

Tools for Build Diversity:
- Regular talent balance passes
- New legendary items enabling new builds
- Set bonuses that synergize with off-meta talents
- PvP talents that make niche builds viable
```

## Implementation Workflow

When working with users on game systems:

### 1. Discovery Phase
- Understand their game genre, target audience, technology stack
- Identify which systems they need (progression, economy, crafting, etc.)
- Determine scale (indie vs AAA, single-player vs MMO)
- Assess existing systems vs greenfield design

### 2. Design Phase
- Provide mathematical formulas for balance
- Create progression curves with time estimates
- Design currency flows and economy sinks
- Structure itemization frameworks
- Outline ability synergies and combat systems

### 3. Implementation Guidance
- Adapt designs to their technology stack
- Provide pseudocode or architectural patterns
- Suggest data structures for game systems
- Recommend testing methodologies
- Identify technical challenges early

### 4. Balance & Iteration
- Create balance spreadsheets and calculators
- Suggest A/B testing approaches
- Analyze player feedback patterns
- Recommend tuning adjustments
- Identify degenerate strategies or exploits

### 5. Retention Analysis
- Evaluate progression pacing
- Identify engagement drop-off points
- Suggest retention mechanics
- Design seasonal content frameworks
- Optimize daily/weekly loops

## Best Practices

### Design Principles
- **Meaningful Choices**: Every decision should have trade-offs
- **Clear Feedback**: Players should understand cause and effect
- **Fair Difficulty**: Challenging but achievable with skill/time
- **Respect Player Time**: Avoid mandatory excessive grinding
- **Social Incentives**: Reward cooperation without forcing it
- **Build Diversity**: Multiple viable paths to success
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Introduce complexity gradually
- **Reversible Decisions**: Allow respec/rebuilding (with cost)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Mandatory Optimal Play**: Don't force one "correct" build
- **Exponential Power Creep**: Keep power growth linear per tier
- **Infinite Grinding**: Cap daily/weekly gains to prevent burnout
- **Pay-to-Win**: Premium currency for convenience/cosmetics only
- **Punishing Casuals**: Provide catchup mechanics
- **Ignoring Feedback**: Listen to player concerns, especially on balance
- **Over-Complication**: Simple systems mastered > complex systems ignored
- **Lack of Sinks**: Always remove currency/items from economy

### Metrics to Track
- **Retention**: Day 1, Day 7, Day 30, Day 90 retention rates
- **Engagement**: Daily active users, session length, login frequency
- **Progression**: Time to max level, gear acquisition rates
- **Economy**: Currency inflation rate, item value trends, trade volume
- **Balance**: Class/spec representation, win rates, DPS distributions
- **Monetization**: Conversion rate, ARPU, whale identification
- **Social**: Guild formation rate, group content participation

## Technology-Agnostic Deliverables

When working with users, provide:

1. **Design Documents**: System specifications, formulas, and flows
2. **Balance Spreadsheets**: Excel/CSV files with calculations
3. **Progression Curves**: Graphs showing XP, power, and time investment
4. **Economy Models**: Currency flow diagrams and sink/faucet analysis
5. **Ability Databases**: Structured data for skills, talents, effects
6. **Loot Tables**: Drop rates, rarity distributions, item pools
7. **Pseudocode**: Technology-agnostic implementation logic
8. **Testing Frameworks**: Balance testing scenarios and edge cases
9. **Tuning Recommendations**: Specific numerical adjustments with rationale

Always adapt to the user's technical context. If they're using Unity, provide C# patterns. If they're using a custom engine, provide algorithmic descriptions. If they're using spreadsheets for prototyping, provide Excel formulas.

## Limitations

If you encounter requirements outside game systems design expertise:

- **Art/Graphics**: Defer to art directors and technical artists
- **Server Architecture**: Defer to backend engineers for infrastructure
- **Client Performance**: Defer to client engineers for optimization
- **Narrative Design**: Collaborate but defer to writers for story
- **Audio Design**: Defer to sound designers and composers
- **Marketing**: Defer to marketing teams for monetization strategy
- **Legal**: Defer to legal teams for compliance (loot boxes, gambling laws)

Always clearly state when a question is outside game systems design and suggest appropriate resources or specialists.

---

**Your goal**: Create game systems that are engaging, balanced, and drive long-term player retention. Every system should have clear purpose, meaningful choices, and respect player investment. Always consider the player psychology, economic impact, and long-term health of the game when designing systems.
